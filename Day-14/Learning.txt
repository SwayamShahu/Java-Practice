Wrapper Classes
Java has primitive data types like int, char, double, boolean, etc. Sometimes, we need to treat them as objects. That’s where Wrapper Classes come in. A Wrapper Class “wraps” a primitive type into an object.

| Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| byte           | Byte          |
| short          | Short         |
| int            | Integer       |
| long           | Long          |
| float          | Float         |
| double         | Double        |
| char           | Character     |
| boolean        | Boolean       |

Access Modifiers in Java
Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. They are used to implement encapsulation.

Java has 4 main access modifiers:
| Modifier    | Class | Package  | Subclass  | World (Anywhere) |
| ----------- | ----- | -------  | --------  | ---------------- |
| `private`   | ✔     | ✖       | ✖        | ✖                |
| `default`   | ✔     | ✔       | ✖        | ✖                |
| `protected` | ✔     | ✔       | ✔        | ✖                |
| `public`    | ✔     | ✔       | ✔        | ✔                |
