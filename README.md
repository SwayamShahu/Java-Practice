Java Daily Practice Challenge

Welcome to my Java Daily Practice Challenge repository! 👨‍💻

This is a personal challenge where I aim to practice Java daily, focusing on one concept at a time. Each day, I create a new folder (e.g., Day1, Day2, etc.) that contains:
 - A Learning.txt file with a brief revision of the Java concept
 - A few practice questions based on that concept
 - My solutions, which I implement and continuously improve

🔄 Workflow:
 - Revise a specific Java concept (like Java operators, loops, OOP)
 - Ask ChatGPT for practice questions related to that concept
 - Solve the questions and upload the code in that day's folder

📁 Folder Structure:
------------------------------------------------------------
Day1/
  - Learning.txt
  - Problem1.java
  - Problem2.java
Day2/
  - Learning.txt
  - Problem1.java
  ...
------------------------------------------------------------

📌 Goals:
 - Reinforce core Java concepts
 - Improve problem-solving and code readability
 - Build a consistent coding habit
