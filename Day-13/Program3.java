/*
3. Advanced Level: The BankAccount Class üè¶ Task: Create a robust BankAccount class with strict rules for data modification. 
Data Members (Private): 
    - accountNumber (long or String) 
    - accountHolderName (String) 
    - balance (double) 
Methods (Public): 
    - Constructor: A constructor to initialize the account with an accountNumber, accountHolderName, and an initial balance. 
    - Getters: Public getter methods for all three fields. 
    - Immutability: There should be no setter for accountNumber. This property should be immutable after the object is created. 
    - deposit(double amount): This method should add to the balance. It must validate that the deposit amount is a positive number. 
    - withdraw(double amount): This method should subtract from the balance. It must validate two conditions: the withdrawal amount is positive, and the transaction will not result in a negative balance (i.e., check for insufficient funds).        
    - balance (i.e., check for insufficient funds). 
Goal: To implement a class with immutable properties (accountNumber) and a critical state (balance) that is carefully managed through methods with strict validation rules.
