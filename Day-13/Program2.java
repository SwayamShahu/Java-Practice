/* 
2. Intermediate Level: The Car Class ðŸš— Task: Design a class named Car that models a real-world car, controlling its state through methods. 
Data Members (Private): 
    - make (String) 
    - model (String) 
    - year (int) 
    - speed (int) 
Methods (Public): 
    - Constructor: A constructor that initializes make, model, and year. The speed must always be initialized to 0. 
    - getSpeed(): A method to return the current speed. 
    - accelerate(): A method that increases the speed by 5. 
    - brake(): A method that decreases the speed by 5. 
    - Constraint: The speed must never become negative. Ensure your brake() method handles this condition. There should be no public setSpeed() method; speed can only be changed via accelerate() and brake(). 
Goal: To understand how encapsulation controls an object's state by forcing interaction through defined behaviors rather than allowing direct modification of data members.
