Looping in Java

1. while loop:
   - The while loop is used when we do not know the number of iterations in advance.
   - Syntax:
        while (condition) {
            // code to be executed
        }

2. do-while loop:
   - Similar to while loop, but guarantees at least one execution of the code block.
   - Syntax:
        do {
            // code to be executed
        } while (condition);

3. for loop:
   - The most commonly used loop when the number of iterations is known.
   - Syntax:
        for (initialization; condition; update) {
            // code to be executed
        }


Jumping Statements in Java

1. break:
   - Used to terminate the loop immediately when a certain condition is met.
   - Example:
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) break;
            System.out.println(i);
        }

2. continue:
   - Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Example:
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) continue;
            System.out.println(i);
        }
